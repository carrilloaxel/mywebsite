## Prove that if $M$ is a path-connected smooth manifold then given $p_1,p_2\in M$ there exists a differentiable map from $p_1$ to $p_2$.

Remembering the definition of differentiable map:

## Let $S(n):=\{M\in M_n(\mathbb{R})| M^t=M\}$. Prove that $S(n)$ is a manifold of dimension $n(n+1)/2$. Show that the function is differentiable and compute $df_M$ for any $M\in M_n(\mathbb{R})$. In particular compute $df_{\operatorname{Id}_n}$. 


## Show that a subset $X$ of a manifold $M$ is a submanifold of the same dimension if and only if is open.


## Given two smooth manifolds $M,N$
